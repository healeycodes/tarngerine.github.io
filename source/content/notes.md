    - the problem w programming is humans, not computers  
    - programming is more like novel writing than it is engineering (i.e. phsyical engineering) bc theres no actual constraints besides how the programmer things. engineers run up to the same physical constraints (e.g. russian vs us space programs basically ended up doing the same things, whereas two programmers solving the same prompt write v diff programs)
