It's pretty wild to think that at the beginning of this year I was in a toxic relationship with my job. I had a big falling out with one of the people I deeply respected in leadership over the holidays, and it was apparent to me that while we agreed on many humanity-level morals (something I screened for when applying for a job post-Facebook), the day-to-day values were wildly misaligned (from how important transparency is, to how product strategy should be formed).

Throughout that job I had been working with a therapist, and the majority of our work is on positive psychology. Some of the big lessons we focused on were:

* Accepting things I cannot control
* Realizing that I have control over how I view things (positively vs negatively), and how to act on that choice
* Identifying my top personal values to guide any decisions I needed to make in the future
* More recently, identifying and combatting low self-esteem

One of the things we discussed was how important work actually is to me. There's a lot of anti-work discourse, and a lot of folks who ended up in tech realizing and discussing how much they dislike tech. That's not me — I genuinely love technology. I grew up around computers, and this is my "dream" industry. I love everything about software. However, social pressure and low self-esteem led me to be swept along this discourse, hating a thing I really liked. Once I was able to identify this friction, it eased a lot of my turmoil.

Last time I wrote, I identified this tight feeling in my chest. As of a month or two ago, it's mostly disappeared. I'm not entirely sure why. It could be that I secured a solid rate from my client, and work for that client really picked up. The days when I have it again are usually the empty days — the days I'm supposed to take off. And this is where the discourse around work-life-balance starts to cause friction in me again.

I accept that many folks have an unhealthy relationship with work. I am also a victim to hustle culture (identifying when this flares up and stopping it is still a challenge, takes a few days). However, one of my main personal values is the love of learning. The reason I like to think about my current client's project is how much I'm learning from it. I'm a tech lead, and there are so many engineering concepts and low level details to think about!

So for now, it seems I've found a good balance. Work is interesting, I'm making more progress in how I react to my surroundings, and currently tackling self esteem.

Looking ahead to 2021, I've been talking with potential accountants to discuss how to structure my business. A big thing I had to work through while we discussed filing as an S Corp was the delineation between just "selling my time" as a freelancer, vs "making a profit" as a business-owner (specifically, the benefit of an S Corp is paying yourself a salary that's lower than your total intake — how do you argue the difference between a reasonable salary and what you take as a distribution?). This discussion was a difficult one for me to have, not only with the CPAs, but with myself. I have such a gut-level reaction to the idea of making profit and capitalism (again due to much of the anti-capitalism discourse I read), that I was really uncomfortable with this shift in thinking. However, I've since come around, thanks to a convo with my partner, to a more positive way to think about it. If I'm able to subcontract some of the work to an apprentice, and contribute value through guidance and mentorship, the idea of making profit would satisfy the-very-not-black-and-white interpretation of a business (i.e. S corp filing) and still feels in line with my personal ethics (love of learning often comes with love of sharing those learnings).

I also have a potentially exciting partnership with a friend, and I'm super excited to do occasional team ups / collaborations.

I'm currently awaiting confirmation that the business name I chose is available — super exciting. I hope it is! 

Given my recent work as a tech lead, I'm also considering a reframe of my role from an independent product designer to an "independent software creative". Creative technologist and design engineer are the closest roles but neither feel quite right. Many Creative Technologists I know work in advertisement, and Design Engineering still feels very murky to me — is it design or engineering? It also feels much less experimental than I want to feel. Being a software creative focuses on the fact that I'm working in software, with a focus on creativity.

A lot of this is driven by my current experience with MakeSpace. It's been a wild past 3 months, working on the 2nd version of the prototype. I'm leading a few contractors and building a performant, multiplayer web application from scratch. I've learned so much about React and Javascript (due to closures), as well as WebGL, CRDT-like data structures, WebRTC... it's incredibly rare to be in this position of having so much to learn. I won't lie, there are still ups and downs — bugs are infinitely more difficult to resolve in a multiplayer environment, and performance... I'm very excited to get better at that :p

I'm excited for 2021!
