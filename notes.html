<li>&quot;Don&#39;t be cute&quot;<br></li>
<li>The problem w programming is humans, not computers<br></li>
<li>Programming is more like novel writing than it is engineering (i.e. phsyical engineering) bc theres no actual constraints besides how the programmer things. engineers run up to the same physical constraints (e.g. russian vs us space programs basically ended up doing the same things, whereas two programmers solving the same prompt write v diff programs)</li>

<ul>
<li>A sick system has four basic rules:</li>
<li>Rule 1: Keep them too busy to think.</li>
<li>Rule 2: Keep them tired.</li>
<li>Rule 3: Keep them emotionally involved.</li>
<li>Rule 4: Reward intermittently.</li>
<li>How do you do all this?</li>
<li>Keep the crises rolling.</li>
<li>Things will be better when...</li>
<li>Keep real rewards distant.</li>
<li>Establish one small semi-occasional success.</li>
<li>Chop up their time.</li>
<li>Enmesh your success with theirs.</li>
<li>Keep everything on the edge.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>According to this way of thinking, labor is not something one does for compensation, but an act of self-love. If profit doesn’t happen to follow, it is because the worker’s passion and determination were insufficient. Its real achievement is making workers believe their labor serves the self and not the marketplace.</li>
<li>Work becomes divided into two opposing classes: that which is lovable (creative, intellectual, socially prestigious) and that which is not (repetitive, unintellectual, undistinguished).</li>

<li>Quote from The Hidden Injuries of Class — Richard Sennett: &quot;There is an interesting paradox here... the more transparent and “user-friendly” the computerised processes are, the more opaque the total process they control becomes.&quot;</li>

<ul>
<li>America’s vast therapeutic brain trust has steadily eradicated the language of solidarity and class consciousness, honed through collective struggle, and replaced it with exhortations to “do what you love” and “live your best life.” Both aphorisms imply that what we’re currently doing is not enough.</li>
<li>We are denied the ability to seek comfort from colleagues, neighbors, or—heaven forbid—comrades, because neoliberalism has turned them into our competition.</li>
<li>It is no coincidence that as we become more nervous, “wellness” and “self-care” have become mainstream industries.</li>
</ul></li>
